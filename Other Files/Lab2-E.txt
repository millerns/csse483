FrameLayout is designed to block out an area on the screen to display a single item. You can add multiple children to a FrameLayout, and control their position within the FrameLayout by assigning << gravity >> to each child. 

Children are drawn in a stack, with the << most recently added child on top >>

The size of the frame layout is << the size of its largest child plus padding >>
